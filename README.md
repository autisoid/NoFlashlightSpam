# NoFlashlightSpam
"impulse 100" command can be used both to turn on and off the H.E.V. flashlight, which produces a nasty sound once toggled. This plugin prevents players from spamming flashlight toggle, which also may make server laggy when used together with speedhack.

# NoFlashlightSpamAddon
Install it too if you have wootguy's anticheat on the server to prevent the players from spamming flashlight when they speedhack (a bypass of the OG plugin from me)
